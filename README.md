# 📱 Playgrounds

Welcome to the **Playgrounds** repository! This is a personal space for experimenting, prototyping, and learning **iOS development** and the **Swift programming language** using Xcode Playgrounds.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo is designed to help me:

- Practice Swift syntax and concepts
- Explore iOS frameworks like UIKit and SwiftUI
- Build small proof-of-concept features
- Try out new APIs or language features
- Learn by doing — fast, focused, and iterative

## 📂 Structure

Each folder represents an independent Playground with a specific topic or experiment. For example:

```
Playgrounds/
├── SwiftBasics/
├── UIKitExperiments/
├── SwiftUIAnimations/
└── NetworkingExamples/
```

> You can open each `.playground` file directly in Xcode.

## 🛠 Requirements

- macOS (Ventura or later recommended)
- Xcode 15 or later
- Basic understanding of Swift

## 🧠 Topics Explored

- ✅ Swift fundamentals
- ✅ SwiftUI & UIKit
- ✅ View layouts and animations
- ✅ iOS app architecture concepts
- ✅ Networking and JSON decoding
- ✅ Async/await, Combine, and concurrency

## 📌 Notes

This is a living workspace — experiments may be incomplete, unstable, or intentionally broken to explore errors and fixes. It’s all part of the learning process.
